# AssistiveTechPassport
Users of Assistive Technology report challenges in having their requirements met as they progress through life stages, 
such as moving from school to college or when changing employment. 
Research carried out by Enable Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland has identified the creation of an Assistive Technology Passport,
a record which could be carried by the user through all life stages and shared by the service user as necessary to external organizations, 
as a potential solution to ensure smooth and consistent service delivery, as well as being a key component of developing a more varied Assistive Technology
ecosystem for users.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this concept, designing a prototype web application which meets these 
requirements while implementing data sharing protocols which follow a model of negotiated consent. The accessibility and usability requirements
for this application will be high, as some service users may also have visual impairments.


#Instructions
To run the project, you will need to install the django framework. The project is currently configured to run on a PostGres database, and the existing 
migrations may need to be removed to run on another database.
